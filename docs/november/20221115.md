Term V.O.T.A

To get to VOTA, we have thing called "Definition of Ready".


VOTA -> Vision, O, T, Action
example:
  vision -> "i have to pee",
  action -< "go pee"


"O" and "T" are Obstacles and Transformational Processes (how to overcome obstancles)

Obstacle -> closed door, maybe?
Transformational Process -> open the door

So VOTA stands for Vision -> Obstacle -> Transformational Process -> Action
You cannot complete the next step until the current step is "compete"
